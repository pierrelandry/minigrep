# Minigrep

I like to learn new languages by re-implementation of tools and commands that I use on a daily basis.

`grep` is a useful command tool for finding substrings within a string in Unix-like operating systems.

With `minigrep` we will read a file and search for a specific string in that file.

The functionnalities will be developed in TDD.

## TODO

- [] Read a file
- [] Search for specific lines passed as argument
- Allow user to configure `minigrep' via environment variable
- Write errors to `stderr
